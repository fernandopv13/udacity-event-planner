MUST-HAVE


NICE-TO-HAVE

Fix tests that fail (exclusively) in Firefox


Expand test coverage to include current xit's.

Expand test coverage to Controller and its delegates.

Move effects of UI actions (e.g. submit) out from View tests to ViewUpdateHandler tests, so that business logic testing does not rely on UI implementation 

Add top margin to description field in event form (too close to radios when active)

Get password confirmations into the right tab order.

Support use of return key for submitting forms.

Increase size of button links on front pages; hard to activate on small phones

Scroll to field with autofocus; iPhone 5 scrolls down past it

Move Materialize toast out to generic widget that abstracts away the reference to Materialize

Add image upload widget based on dropify library. Combine with localStorage of images to allow uploading of custom images for account profile and guest (person).

Transition to e.g. Angular.js to get past Router fragility.

Upgrade to newest version of Materialize-css.
